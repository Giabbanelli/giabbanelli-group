I am a Full Professor at Old Dominion University, specializing in artificial intelligence applications for population health interventions. My research integrates artificial intelligence, modeling, and health, with applications to a broad portfolio of conditions including obesity, suicide prevention, COVID, or HIV. I have published over 130 articles and received numerous accolades, including the Annual Outstanding Faculty Research Award from Miami University and recognition as a top 2% scientist worldwide by Scopus for several years. In addition to 15 years of experience in extensive scientific leadership and team building, I provide service to the research community on the editorial board of several journals (e.g., BMC Digital Health, Intelligence-Based Medicine, BMC Medical Informatics & Decision Making) or as program chair and general chair of international ACM/IEEE conferences. I have received funding as principal investigator from major federal organizations (e.g., NIH, NSF, CDC), companies (e.g., Microsoft), and organizations abroad.
